This is a web application that launches on your local machine and can be used to store and manage information about your home video library stored on CD-R discs - it helps to find out on what disc in which package a film is written. 

I used the following tech stack here: GWT 2.0, openGSE, iBatis 3.0, Derby 10.5.3, Guice 2.0.

## How to use:

1. Download archive
2. Extract it
3. Execute run.bat
If your browser returns "This webpage is not available" error, try to refresh page using F5 - this should help.
